                  In my final year studying Game Development, part of the
                  curriculum was a group project. So, the summer before school
                  started, a couple of friends asked me if I wanted to form a
                  team with them. When we got together to brainstorm about the
                  idea, we decided to continue working on a game jam that a
                  couple of them did some time before that.
                </span>

                <br />
                <span>
                  The game is about a chicken who is tired of being stuck in a
                  farm. She wants to escape and, using her mental link to her
                  ancestors, devolve back into a dinosaur. By solving puzzles,
                  parkouring and dodging or fighting enemies, the player can
                  escape the farm and win freedom for the chicken.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text06" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  This project was the biggest project I had worked on up until
                  then. Working in a team of 5 people, proper communication was
                  required in order to bring this project to a success. The game
                  was made in Unreal Engine 5 and using Hacknplan and Perforce
                  for planning and version control.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text09" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I was one of two programmers one the team. At the start of the
                  project, when discussing who would be responsible for certain
                  areas of the game, it was decided that I would mainly focus on
                  AI and UI.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text12" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  For the AI side of my work, there were a couple of NPCs in the
                  game. Each had its own behaviour, being either friendly or
                  enemy, wandering or patrolling. For these behaviours, I made
                  use of Unreal Engine’s build-in behaviour tree. This made
                  defining behaviour for all different NPCs very easy. Using
                  C++, I made custom nodes to be used in the behaviour tree.
                  Most of these nodes were made as general nodes, so they could
                  be used by multiple NPCs, even though their behaviour was
                  different.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text15" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Working on the game’s UI was a lot more fun than I thought it
                  would be. Having never made a UI for a bigger game, I didn’t
                  really know what to expect. Finding out the best ways to link
                  up all of the UI elements with actions that happened in-game
                  was challenging at times, but super fun. The in-game UI
                  consisted of a minimalistic static UI, showing only the bare
                  minimum, wanting to maximise the immersion of the game. This
                  was coupled by pop-ups which either taught the player how to
                  interact with the world or showed dialogue boxes when talking
                  to NPCs.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text18" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  At the end of the level, we wanted a small boss fight. We
                  decided that the guard dog of the farm would make for a good
                  enemy. This dog would chase the player all the way to the end
                  of the level. The player had to use everything they learned
                  throughout the level to clear a path and escape. The dog had
                  to rubber-band after the player, never getting too far from
                  the player, but also not too fast that the player wouldn’t
                  have time to react. There were gaps in the road that the dog
                  had to jump over and a split of paths where the dog had to
                  take another path than the player.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text21" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  I spend a big part of the development process to get this boss
                  fight to feel challenging but rewarding. After a bunch of
                  playtesting, with a lot of different people, we eventually got
                  the feedback that the chase was fun challenge.
                </span>
                <br class="devolution-text24" />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Other than AI and UI, which were my main responsibilities, I
                  worked on some of the puzzles that were spread around the
                  level. These puzzles included loose planks, opening gates and
                  falling boulders.
